**Overview**

In this hands-on workshop, we will explore the concept of multi-agent AI frameworks, emphasizing their importance and unique advantages over single, monolithic models. Attendees will learn how the collaboration of multiple specialized agents can outperform a single powerful model by leveraging task-specific expertise and diverse perspectives. The workshop will provide practical guidance on deploying LLM and VLM agents and connecting them to each other using straightforward coding frameworks like Crew AI and Autogen.
