The model is essentially the “brain” of the agent, and we can pass any of the Gemini models to Google ADK agents. However, it is important to note that we can also pass other families of models, such as those from OpenAI and Anthropic, to Google ADK as well. This is very straightforward, and you can read more about it in the documentation, but we will not delve into those details in this notebook.\n",

As we move forward and our agent systems become more complex, however, each agent will increasingly need an identity. Agents need to understand each other’s “philosophy of being,” main responsibilities, and reason for existing. The name and description of an agent are primarily used so that other agents can refer to it and understand its role.

How can I assist you today?</p></div></div><div class=\"user-row\"><div class=\"user-bubble\">Is radiology a good specialty for residency?</div><div class=\"avatar avatar-user\">👤</div></div><div class=\"agent-row\"><div class=\"avatar avatar-agent\">🤖</div><div class=\"agent-bubble\"><p>Radiology is often considered a very good specialty for residency, and for a number of reasons that appeal to different individuals. Here are some of the common advantages and aspects that make it attractive:<br />\n",
              "1.  <strong>Intellectual Stimulation:</strong> It's a highly intellectual field that requires a deep understanding of anatomy, pathology, physics (of imaging), and clinical medicine. Radiologists act as consultants to nearly every other specialty.<br />\n",
              "2.  <strong>Breadth of Knowledge:</strong> You get exposure to a vast range of diseases and organ systems, which can be very stimulating if you enjoy broad medical knowledge rather than hyper-specialization in one area.<br />\n",
              "3.  <strong>Technology-Driven:</strong> For those who enjoy working with cutting-edge technology and constantly evolving tools, radiology is an excellent fit.<br />\n",
              "4.  <strong>Work-Life Balance (Relative):</strong> While residency is demanding in any field, the <em>post-residency</em> lifestyle in radiology can often offer a better work-life balance compared to some surgical or very demanding medical specialties, though this varies greatly by practice setting (academic vs. private, subspecialty, call burden).<br />\n",
              "5.  <strong>Procedural Opportunities:</strong> While much of radiology is diagnostic, interventional radiology offers a significant procedural component for those who enjoy hands-on work. Even diagnostic radiologists perform procedures like biopsies, drainages, and line placements.<br />\n",
              "6.  <strong>Demand and Job Market:</strong> Historically, the job market for radiologists has been quite stable and often robust, though it can fluctuate with economic conditions and healthcare trends.<br />\n",
              "7.  <strong>Subspecialization:</strong> Radiology offers numerous subspecialties (e.g., neuroradiology, musculoskeletal, body imaging, pediatric, interventional, breast imaging), allowing you to focus on an area of particular interest after general training.<br />\n",
              "However, like any specialty, it also has its challenges:<br />\n",
              "*   <strong>Long Training:</strong> Diagnostic radiology residency is typically 5 years (including an intern year), and interventional radiology is even longer (6 years).<br />\n",
              "*   <strong>Intense Learning Curve:</strong> The sheer volume of information to learn, from normal anatomy to countless pathologies across all modalities, is immense.<br />\n",
              "*   <strong>Limited Direct Patient Contact:</strong> If you are drawn to medicine primarily for direct, long-term patient interaction and relationship building, diagnostic radiology might feel less fulfilling as much of the work is done in front of a computer screen.<br />\n",
              "*   <strong>Sedentary Nature:</strong> It can be a very sedentary job, sitting for long hours interpreting studies.<br />\n",
              "Ultimately, whether radiology is a \"good\" specialty depends on your personal interests, strengths, and career goals. If you enjoy problem-solving, technology, complex visual information, and a broad understanding of disease, it can be an incredibly rewarding career.</p></div></div><div class=\"user-row\"><div class=\"user-bubble\">exit</div><div class=\"avatar avatar-user\">👤</div></div><div class=\"sys-log\">🔴 Session ended.</div></div>"

        "\n",
        "- **Events** are referring to anything that might have happened since the time that you started your agent—any kind of task that you assigned to that agent, what that agent replied to, how many tokens it used, what kind of modality your input and output data had\n",
        "- **Artifacts** might include images, videos, or voice commands that needed to be stored\n",
        "- **Memory** tracks variables that the agent should have kept in its memory\n",
        "- **Sessions** are individual instances of agent activity. Agents in Google ADK can engage in **multiple simultaneous conversations** with different users (or take actions on their behalves), where each user has its own session. Therefore, keeping track of which sessions are currently active, who has spoken with the agent, and how events and states have evolved in each session is another fundamental aspect of the Google ADK framework that makes it an ideal choice for web service applications that can later be served to **FastAPI** or other backend-to-framework communication protocols."

              "*   <strong>Accelerating Workflows and Reducing Burden:</strong> AI-enabled systems are being utilized to accelerate image acquisition and reconstruction, potentially allowing for more studies per day and providing radiologists with higher-quality data sooner. These systems also aim to reduce the administrative burden on radiologists, freeing them to concentrate on image interpretation and patient communication.<br />\n",
              "*   <strong>Enhanced Reporting:</strong> New technologies like Scriptor Software's rScriptor SmartMacros, introduced this week, enable radiologists to populate multiple report sections with a single macro, embedding numerical data and text. These SmartMacros can automatically insert appropriate ACR Incidental Findings follow-up recommendations, reducing dictation time and improving consistency. Additionally, Mosaic Clinical Technologies, through its acquisition of Cognita Imaging Inc., launched Mosaic Drafting™, an AI solution that generates preliminary drafts for X-rays and head CTs, demonstrating improved detection rates and efficiency. While large language models (LLMs) can simplify oncologic CT reports for patients to improve comprehension, radiologist oversight remains crucial to address potential clinical errors.<br />\n",
              "*   <strong>Advanced Detection and Screening:</strong> Research published in Nature Scientific Reports highlighted an AI algorithm from Riverain Technologies that can calculate coronary artery calcium scores from non-contrast CT scans with performance comparable to radiologists, advancing opportunistic screening. RadNet also launched an AI-enabled breast cancer detection service that incorporates an AI-driven review for suspicious findings and personalized risk assessment. Furthermore, mammography radiomic models have shown promise in predicting occult invasive breast cancer in women with confirmed ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).<br />\n",
              "*   <strong>Image Enhancement:</strong> Bracco Imaging announced ANVISA clearance in Brazil for AiMIFY™, an AI technology that amplifies contrast enhancement in brain MRI scans. This innovation aims to provide radiologists with improved contrast information, particularly aiding in the visualization of small and poorly enhanced lesions.<br />\n",
              "*   <strong>Generative AI and Foundation Models:</strong> A review published in RSNA Journals explored the evolving role of foundation models (FMs) and generative AI in radiology, discussing their applications in areas like synthetic image generation and multimodal data integration. The review also highlighted the challenges associated with their clinical integration, such as interpretability, potential bias, and privacy concerns.<br />\n",

PCD-CT is also being optimized for applications such as rectal cancer T staging. Dunlee announced its participation at RSNA 2025, where it will showcase breakthroughs in Ultra-High Resolution (UHR) and Photon Counting CT.<br />\n",
              "*   <strong>Dynamic Digital Radiography (DDR):</strong> Konica Minolta Healthcare announced that Dynamic Digital Radiography (DDR) will be featured in seven scientific presentations at RSNA 2025. This low-dose digital X-ray advancement allows for the visualization of anatomy in motion and has demonstrated clinical value in diagnosing various conditions, including interstitial lung disease, COPD, lung cancer, and pulmonary thrombo-embolism, often without the need for contrast.<br />\n",
              "*   <strong>Advanced MRI:</strong> New research highlighted C-FLAIR, a fluid-attenuated inversion recovery technique with controlled artifact suppression in brain MRI, which has been shown to reduce artifacts that can mimic hyperintense white matter lesions.<br />\n",
              "*   <strong>Therapeutic Ultrasound:</strong> Stanford researchers have developed a novel, drug-free ultrasound method that successfully removed molecular waste and reduced inflammation in the brains of mice, with plans to translate this approach to human clinical testing for neurological diseases.<br />\n",
              "<strong>Radiation Dose Reduction:</strong><br />\n",
              "Patient safety remains a priority, with several new research studies highlighting improved protocols for reducing CT radiation dose.<br />\n",
              "<strong>Workforce Challenges:</strong><br />\n",
              "The radiology field is actively addressing workforce challenges. A report by the Canadian Association of Medical Radiation Technologists revealed a \"workforce crisis\" due to burnout and a demand for MRI and CT exams that outpaces professional growth, leading to significant vacancy rates. The acquisition of Cognita Imaging Inc. by Mosaic Clinical Technologies aims to address the global radiologist capacity crisis by using AI to expand capacity and enhance clinical performance.<br />\n",

These pipelines leverage the power of more than one agent to achieve things that a single agent might not be able to do—or might not be able to do with good quality.\n",

        "\n",
        "In the Google ADK framework, connection of agents to each other follows one of three main patterns:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Sequential Pipeline:** As the name implies, a combination of two or more agents that are called one after the other, where the output of each may or may not be the input of the subsequent agents.\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src=\"https://google.github.io/adk-docs/assets/sequential-agent.png\" width=\"600\" alt=\"Sequential Agent Pattern\">\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Parallel Pipeline:** A setup where multiple agents are called to work on different aspects of the same problem at the same time. Notably, these aspects should be independent from each other—neither agent has access to the inputs or outputs of the other agents.\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src=\"https://google.github.io/adk-docs/assets/parallel-agent.png\" width=\"600\" alt=\"Parallel Agent Pattern\">\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Loop Agent:** An agent that keeps doing whatever it has been doing until a specific set of checkpoints have been met. You may wonder, \"wasn't this supposed to be a multi-agent entity? Why are we talking about a single agent?\" Because a loop agent usually acts as the **organizer** or **gatekeeper** of multiple agents working at the same time.\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src=\"https://google.github.io/adk-docs/assets/loop-agent.png\" width=\"600\" alt=\"Loop Agent Pattern\">\n",
        "\n",
        "As we will see in the next examples, Google ADK enables you to wrap agents—and even multi-agent pipelines—under other agents or multi-agent pipelines. For example, imagine a sequential pipeline of agents that are all introduced as sub-agents to a loop agent, meaning that loop agent is going to keep calling this sequential pipeline until the desired outcome has been achieved.\n",

        "\n",
        "We are going to use a **SequentialAgent** from Google ADK that accepts a name and description as before, but unlike the prior agents we had, will **not receive direct instructions**. The reason is that even though this type of agent is named \"sequential agent,\" it is not a real agent but mostly an agent whose task is to pass its inputs through a chain of sub-agents that it has.\n",

        "\n",
        "Whenever you are dealing with sub-agents and complicated multi-agent frameworks, it's better to rely as much as you can on the **hierarchy of files and folders** for your agents and sub-agents. Not only does Google ADK work best with this format, but it is also the most clear way of representing multi-agent pipelines in code.\n",

        "\n",
        "Well, that's what real multi-agent workflows look like! You **rarely use these multi-agent workflows for chatting**. Mostly, you let them go into the wilderness and do jobs for you that might not be easy for you to do—or at least would take a lot of your time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Even though multi-agent pipelines might still have some requirement to chat with the user, the chat assignment is often **delegated to a specific one of the many agents** that are present in the pipeline, and is mostly used for cases where the agent runs into any difficulty.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Takeaway:** We would like you to have this concept in mind—most of our day-to-day interactions with agents are for conversations, but a **real agentic workflow is often focused on doing a real task**.\n",

        "\n",
        "This, to be honest with you, wasn't designed on purpose. Even though you could try to ask the formatter agent (which is the last agent in our pipeline) to give you back a markdown file and maybe save it to disk as the biography agent did, you might notice that this is **not a very reliable setup**.\n",

        "Think of the session as a **context** that you can engineer for the agent and fill it with data, information, and insights that will help your agents work as expected. You might have heard about things like **memory** that agents could have and can rely on for remembering things—well, these are things that someone can save on an agent pipeline session and are immediately accessible to agents.\n",
        "\n",
        "Regardless, let's put aside the deeper aspects of sessions as they go a little bit beyond the scope of our today's workshop.\n",

        "### Session Service\n",
        "\n",
        "**SessionService** is responsible for managing conversation history and state for different users and sessions. It keeps track of the messages exchanged.\n",
        "\n",
        "As we were talking about sessions, those of you who might have more experience with coding could have imagined: **where does all this information get stored?** Do we store this in memory or can we store them in databases?\n",
        "\n",
        "Well, the answer is yes to both! The default behavior of Google ADK is to save the sessions in **the system's memory** using `InMemorySessionService`, which is suitable for testing and simple applications. But you can also configure it to save sessions in **SQLite databases**, which is great for production. Even more interesting, you can save everything on **Google Cloud services**, which offer specific types of databases for enterprise-scale deployments.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Runner\n",
        "\n",
        "**Runner** is the main engine to run your entire pipeline and all the sessions at the same time. It orchestrates the interaction flow—it takes user input, routes it to the appropriate agent, manages calls to the LLM and tools based on the agent's logic, handles session updates via the SessionService, and yields events representing the progress of the interaction. The runner keeps track of all the sessions and ensures the multi-agent pipeline can adequately reply and respond to all the requests it is getting from different sessions.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Running Our Networking Agent Programmatically\n",
        "\n",
        "For now, we are going to define a **runner and session** for our networking agent and see how we can get the output of the multi-agent pipeline and save it as markdown.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that previously the `adk run` command was handling all the outputs from the agents for us and could simply pass the ultimate response of the agent pipeline back to be seen by us. But when we are dealing with the runner and sessions ourselves, we should also be **responsible for parsing the outputs** of the agents and figuring out which responses are intermediate and which responses are final.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is exactly what we will do in the next couple of cells. Let's go through all these codes and see if you can follow them."
