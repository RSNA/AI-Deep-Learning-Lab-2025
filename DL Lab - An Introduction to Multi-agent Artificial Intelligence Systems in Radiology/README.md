# Deep Learning Lab: An Introduction to Multi-agent Artificial Intelligence Systems in Radiology

- Moderator: Pouria Rouzrokh MD MPH MHPE
- Speaker: Moein Shariatnia MD
- Speaker: Melina Hosseiny MD

## Overview

In this hands-on workshop, we will explore the concept of multi-agent AI frameworks, emphasizing their importance and unique advantages over single, monolithic models. Attendees will learn how the collaboration of multiple specialized agents can outperform a single powerful model by leveraging task-specific expertise and diverse perspectives. The workshop will provide practical guidance on deploying LLM and VLM agents and connecting them to each other using the Google Agent Development Kit.

## What's Included

This repository contains educational materials and code examples for building multi-agent AI systems using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK). The main educational resource is the Jupyter notebook located in `./RSNA2025_DLL_AgentiAI.ipynb`, which provides:

- Introduction to basic agents (LLM-only)
- Augmenting agents with tools (Google Search, native tools)
- Understanding Google ADK limitations and multi-agent solutions
- Multi-agent pipelines (Sequential, Parallel, Loop)
- Custom runners and session management
- Practical examples with radiology applications
