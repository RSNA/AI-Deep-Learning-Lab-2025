# Deep Learning Lab: Quantifying Uncertainty in Deep Learning

- Moderator: Bradley Erickson MD PhD
- Speaker: Shahriar Faghani MD
- Speaker: Mana Moassefi MD

**Overview**

This course will focus on understanding different types and sources of uncertainty in medical imaging, learning about model calibration and exploring various uncertainity quantification techniques. PyTorch and MONAI to be used for hands-on experience and will include implementing model ensembling, applying Monte Carlo Dropout and integrating conformal prediction methods into practical applications.
