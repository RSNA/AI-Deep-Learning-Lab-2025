# Deep Learning Lab: Patient-Centered Representations with Multi-Modal Graphs

- Moderator: Dimitri Falco PhD
- Speaker: Deborah Langman

**Overview**

This hands-on session focuses on constructing patient-specific graphs by integrating multi-modal data and leveraging advanced graph neural network (GNN) architectures to model relationships across these modalities. The session will emphasize creating rich, patient-focused graph representations and how to use them downstream. While this is an advanced session this could be made into a more beginner-friendly version if need be.
