# Deep Learning Lab: Basics of Natural Language Processing in Radiology

- Moderator: Jae Ho Sohn MD MS
- Speaker: Timothy Chen MD
- Speaker: Gunvant Chaudhari MD
- Speaker: Cody Savage MD

**Overview**

This session will feature a brief lecture introducing the basics of natural language processing (NLP) and highlight potential uses for it in radiology. The goal is to survey standard text preprocessing techniques and traditional NLP approaches as well as modern neural network based approaches. We will follow up the didactic portion with a hands-on Google Colab demo implementing discussed concepts for a text classification task. For best experience, we highly recommend attendees bring a laptop with a keyboard as well as have a Gmail account to access Google Colab.
