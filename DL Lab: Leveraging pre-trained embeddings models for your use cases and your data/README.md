# Deep Learning Lab: Leveraging pre-trained embeddings models for your use cases and your data

- Moderator: Rory Pilgrim Beng
- Speaker: Timo Kohlberger
- Speaker: Jason Klotzer

**Overview**

Interactive workshop showing how to use general-purpose, open weight, pre-trained radiology-specific models to build a specific AI application, with an emphasis on how the approach can be generalized to any arbitrary use-case. The session will be run via a Colab notebook and the application will be built via public data. Specific learning areas will be how to actually call and adapt the pre-trained model, the importance of training data curation, validation techniques, and operating point selection.
