# Deep Learning Lab: Data Extraction from Radiology Reports with LLMs

- Moderator: Walter Wiggins MD PhD
- Speaker: Mindy L. Yang, MD

**Overview**

This interactive course will provide participants with the opportunity to learn the basic principles of information extraction from radiology reports by working through a step-by-step example using radiology reports from a chest x-ray data set. Learners will use a large language model (LLM) to classify radiology reports as positive or negative for specific findings. This session will cover basic concepts in preparing data and training LLMs, as well as using a pre-trained LLM to classify radiology reports. No prior coding or machine learning experience is necessary. 1) Develop a general understanding of how large language models (LLMs) for natural language processing (NLP) are trained. 2) Define the basic concepts of NLP preprocessing for text analysis (e.g. tokenization, embedding). 3) Use embeddings from an LLM to classify chest x-ray reports as positive or negative for specific findings.
